## DEMOS_NOTES

MVP: I went for a first round MVP where functions work, but employee names are now hardcoded.
<br><br>
Phase 2: I will go back and utilize arrays and loops so that all edits are based on a series of user input to specific names, roles, IDs, managers, positions that is completely fluid. <br><br>
In addition, search of All Employees by Dept. or Manager will show only Employees and Dept categories, or Employees and Manager categories.<br><br>
Currently, the AddEmployee function is not inputing Manager Id.
<br><br>
